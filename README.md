# classicnets: Classic Data of Social Networks

The goal of `classicnets` is to make available, compile and conserve
classic data of social networks that are rarely available. We follow a
history of this perspective based on [Linton
Freeman](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Development_of_Social_Network_Analys.html?id=VcxqQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y),
[John
Scott](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-010-0012-6) and
reviews from
[Ibero-America](https://chisocnet.org/social-network-in-ibero-america/).
The data are in the classic `matrix` format.

## Social Network Data

There are other excellent R packages for other and in some cases more
comprehensive data such as
[`igraphdata`](https://github.com/igraph/igraphdata) or
[`networkdata`](https://github.com/schochastics/networkdata), and data
in different formats in the project
[Netzschleuder](https://networks.skewed.de). Likewise, there are many
other classical social network databases in
[UCINET](http://www.analytictech.com/archive/ucinet.htm), which is the
most comprehensive and well established software for social network
analysis of the last decades.
