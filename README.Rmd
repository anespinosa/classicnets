# classicnets: Classic Data of Social Networks

The goal of `classicnets` is to make available, compile and conserve classic data of social networks that are rarely available. We follow a history of this perspective based on [Linton Freeman](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Development_of_Social_Network_Analys.html?id=VcxqQgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y), [John Scott](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13278-010-0012-6) and reviews from [Ibero-America](https://chisocnet.org/social-network-in-ibero-america/). The data are in the classic `matrix` format.
